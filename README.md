Shoot 'em up all the enemies, try to survive, score up as far as you can! <br>



## Controls
- Mouse to Aim <br>
- LMB to fire arms(Some weapons are semi-auto, others are full auto.)<br>
- WASD to move<br>
- R to reload<br>



## Tips(Spoiler alert!)

- streaks<br>
If you kill enemies, Streaks will be counted. Streaks expire after 1 second. Keeping up streaks will score more(exponentially!) on you kill enemies.<br>
Wave 4 is the best scoring spot as your gun is infinite ammo, needs only one shot to kill enemies.
